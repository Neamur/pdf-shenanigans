# Project Overview: Enhanced PDF Manipulation

This repository focuses on advanced PDF manipulation through code, offering a solution to avoid unnecessary subscription fees.

## Key Features

- **Merge PDFs**: The codebase includes a script (`merger.py`) designed to merge multiple PDFs seamlessly.

- **Rotation**: The `Rotator.py` script enables PDF rotation with ease.

- **Numbering Pages**: A customizable numbering system allows users to specify the numbering format, options, and preferences for the numbering system.


### Numbering Pages

- **User Interaction**: Users can select from various options for customizing the numbering process.
  - Choose the starting number and the desired number range.
  - Select the numbering format (e.g., index or sequential).

- **Selection Options**:
  - Number pages from the original PDF or a selected subset.
  - Define the numbering continuity across selected pages.

- **Customization**: Users can specify font types and visual enhancements, such as adding headers or footers.

- **Alignment**: The document showcases an effective alignment strategy using the available width.


### Additional Features

- **Splitting Pages**: The code allows for selective page removal or splitting options.

- **Packaging**: The code is structured for packaging as a PyPI package, a Windows application, and a CLI-based compiled app using Pyinstaller.


## Project Roadmap

This code is an integral part of an ongoing project, where it tries to overcome the challenges of Libreoffice and Adobe Acrobat.
